# Basic Memory for Codex

Basic Memory for Codex is the Codex-native bridge between a working coding thread
and Basic Memory's durable knowledge graph.

It is not a 1:1 copy of the Claude Code plugin. This version leans into Codex
workflows: repo orientation, long-running goals, changed-file evidence, explicit
verification, decision capture, and resumable checkpoints.

## What It Does

- **Orient from memory.** The `bm-orient` skill reads active tasks, open
  decisions, and recent Codex checkpoints before substantial work.
- **Checkpoint work.** `PreCompact` records a private request and the `Stop`
  hook asks the active Codex turn to run `bm-checkpoint` once after compaction.
  The resulting `codex_session` or `coding_session` note is agent-authored from
  the compacted working context, with repository and pull-request evidence.
- **Capture decisions.** The `bm-decide` skill records durable engineering
  decisions with rationale, alternatives, and consequences.
- **Remember lightly.** The `bm-remember` skill saves small facts without turning
  them into a full decision or session note.
- **Write useful memory.** The `bm-writing` skill provides one user-customizable
  standard for the voice, narrative quality, observations, and relations used by
  the plugin's note-writing skills.
- **Share deliberately.** The `bm-share` skill copies personal notes to configured
  team projects only after confirmation.
- **Report status.** The `bm-status` skill shows configuration, reachability,
  shared local hook inbox/flush health, and recent memory state.

The hook scripts carry no logic: the brief, checkpoint coordination, and
lifecycle-event capture all live in the pinned Basic Memory revision behind
`bm hook`. Each is a self-contained PEP 723 script pinned to a Basic Memory Git
ref. All refs are updated together with
`just set-codex-hook-version <sha-or-tag>`.

## Requirements

- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — required: the hooks are PEP 723
  scripts executed via `uv run --script`, which installs their pinned Basic
  Memory revision. Install per platform:
  - macOS: `brew install uv` (or the curl installer below)
  - Linux/macOS: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
  - Windows: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`

Disclosure: uv installs the pinned Basic Memory Git ref on first run and reuses
its cache afterward. Every failure path exits 0 — the hooks never disrupt a
session.

## Install

Install the plugin once from the Basic Memory repository root:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
codex plugin add codex@basic-memory
```

Plugin installation is user-level in Codex, so one install makes the plugin
available across projects on the same machine. Start a new Codex thread after
installing so Codex can load the plugin skills, MCP configuration, and hooks.

When adding the marketplace from the Git repository UI, leave **Sparse paths**
empty. If a sparse checkout is required, include both `.agents/plugins` and
`plugins/codex`. Selecting only `plugins/codex` omits
`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, so Codex correctly reports that the checked
out marketplace root has no supported manifest. The marketplace file should not
be moved into the plugin directory.

Configuration can live at user level in `~/.codex/basic-memory.json` or at
project level in `.codex/basic-memory.json`. User-level settings are the base;
the nearest project file overrides only the keys it declares. `redactKeys` and
`redactPaths` are the privacy exception: their user and project lists accumulate.
The setup skill asks which scope to use and recommends user-level configuration
by default.

To customize how Codex writes memory, edit `skills/bm-writing/SKILL.md` in the
plugin source. `bm-checkpoint`, `bm-decide`, and `bm-remember` all apply that
shared skill while retaining their own schemas and evidence requirements.

## Configuration

Run the setup skill, or create `~/.codex/basic-memory.json` for shared defaults:

```json
{
  "basicMemory": {
    "primaryProject": "my-project",
    "secondaryProjects": [],
    "teamProjects": {},
    "focus": "code/dev",
    "rememberFolder": "codex-remember",
    "recallTimeframe": "7d",
    "captureEvents": true,
    "redactKeys": [],
    "redactPaths": [],
    "placementConventions": "Put decisions in decisions/ and work checkpoints in codex/<repo-dir>/."
  }
}
```

Codex event capture is on by default. Set the JSON boolean `false` at user or
project level to opt out; malformed values fail closed. Captured, redacted
lifecycle-event envelopes land in a local inbox under your Basic Memory home.
The lifecycle trace stays local: `basic-memory hook flush` only moves valid
envelopes into the local retention archive and never creates graph notes. Add
`redactKeys` and `redactPaths` arrays to extend the built-in redaction floor.

Codex ignores PreCompact stdout, so PreCompact cannot ask the model to write a
note directly. It leaves a private request for the Stop hook. Stop then blocks
the turn once with a request to run `bm-checkpoint`; the active model writes an
agent-authored checkpoint from its compacted context, and the next Stop is a
no-op to prevent loops.

When `captureFolder` is omitted, Codex resolves the Git top-level directory and
writes to `codex/<repo-dir>`. An explicit folder still wins.

For a coding profile, keep both the profile and checkout-specific repository
identifier in the project file without duplicating the shared settings:

```json
{
  "basicMemory": {
    "sessionProfile": "coding",
    "repository": "owner/repo"
  }
}
```

The plugin's seed schemas cover notes Codex writes directly: `codex_session`,
`coding_session`, `decision`, and `task`. Coding sessions require structured
repository, repository-root, working-directory, branch, and Git SHA frontmatter;
current pull-request fields are added when a PR exists. Lifecycle envelopes are
operational trace rather than knowledge, so orientation only recalls authored
checkpoint types.

Codex plugin hooks must be reviewed and trusted before they run. Open `/hooks` in
Codex after enabling the plugin and trust the Basic Memory hook definitions.

## Development

From this directory:

```bash
just check
```

From the repo root:

```bash
just package-check-codex
```

The package intentionally keeps Codex-specific configuration separate from
Claude's `.claude/settings.json`.
