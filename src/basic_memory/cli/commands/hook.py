"""bm hook — the harness producer front door (issue #997, SPEC-55).

Harness plugins reduce to manifests plus one-line shims that exec
``bm hook <event> --harness claude|codex`` with the hook JSON on stdin. All
logic lives here: per-harness stdin adapters, the session-start context brief,
the pre-compact checkpoint note, opt-in envelope capture into the inbox WAL,
and the flush/status operator surface.

Contracts:
  - Harness verbs (session-start, pre-compact) are fail-open: any error logs
    to stderr and exits 0 — a hook must never disrupt an agent session.
  - The capture gate is fail-closed: ``captureEvents`` must be the JSON
    boolean ``true``; strings never enable recording.
  - Graph-derived brief content is fenced and labeled as reference data, not
    instructions — the prompt-injection boundary.

Settings sources are the same files the original plugin hook scripts read
(ported here; the plugin hooks are now zero-logic shims that exec these
verbs): the ``basicMemory`` block of ``.claude/settings.json`` /
``.claude/settings.local.json`` (nearest ancestor, over the user-level
``~/.claude/settings.json``) for Claude, and ``.codex/basic-memory.json`` for
Codex. ``install`` / ``remove`` wire the same verbs into the user-level
harness config for standalone (non-marketplace) users, ownership-tagged so
removal is surgical.
