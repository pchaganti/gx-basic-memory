    """Bounded in-process worker pool that drains queued note materializations.

    Mirrors the cloud's queue worker model locally: the accept enqueues a
    materialization and returns; a fixed number of workers pull from per-worker
    queues and run them. Bounding concurrency to `workers` is the point —
    fire-and-forget `create_task` let every deferred file write + index run at
    once, and at high write load they contended en masse for the single SQLite
    writer and the event loop, collapsing the tail (p99) and throughput
    (benchmarks/docs/write-load-benchmark.md). With N workers only N
    materializations are in flight; the rest wait in the queues and drain over
    time, so the accept path stays light AND the writer isn't thrashed.

    Jobs are routed to a worker by their note identity (project_id, entity_id),
    so all jobs for one note run on the same worker FIFO in submission order.
    Materializations for the same note must never run concurrently: the older
    job's file write changes the on-disk checksum, so the newer job's writer
    guard reads unexpected content and publishes a false
    external_change_detected on the LATEST accepted row — the note is never
    materialized and is falsely flagged as conflicted.
