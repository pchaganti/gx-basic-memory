"""Deterministic projector: sweep the inbox into knowledge-graph artifacts.

The interim consumer of the harness WAL (``bm hook flush``) until the SPEC-54
daemon worker lands. No LLM: SessionNote skeletons and ToolLedger entries are
derived mechanically from the captured envelopes.

Idempotent by construction (the EverOS pattern): envelopes are treated as
hints — dedup on ``idempotency_key``, artifacts re-derived with deterministic
titles and ``overwrite=True`` — so WAL replays and duplicate hooks can never
corrupt or double-write. Every run sweeps the whole inbox, so envelopes
captured while nothing was consuming self-heal; there is no missed-event
window.

Writes go through the same internal write path the CLI's ``write-note`` uses
(the MCP ``write_note`` tool via the async client) — never a subprocess.
