# SPEC-10: Unified Deployment Workflow and Event Tracking

## Why

We replaced a complex multi-workflow system with DBOS orchestration that was proving to be more trouble than it was worth. The previous architecture had four separate workflows (`tenant_provisioning`, `tenant_update`, `tenant_deployment`, `tenant_undeploy`) with overlapping logic, complex state management, and fragmented event tracking. DBOS added unnecessary complexity without providing sufficient value, leading to harder debugging and maintenance.

**Problems Solved:**
- **Framework Complexity**: DBOS configuration overhead and fighting framework limitations
- **Code Duplication**: Multiple workflows implementing similar operations with duplicate logic
- **Poor Observability**: Fragmented event tracking across workflow boundaries
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Complex orchestration for fundamentally simple operations
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Framework abstractions hiding simple Python stack traces

## What

This spec documents the architectural simplification that consolidates tenant lifecycle management into a unified system with comprehensive event tracking.

**Affected Areas:**
- Tenant deployment workflows (provisioning, updates, undeploying)
- Event sourcing and workflow tracking infrastructure
- API endpoints for tenant operations
- Database schema for workflow and event correlation
- Integration testing for tenant lifecycle operations

**Key Changes:**
- **Removed DBOS entirely** - eliminated framework dependency and complexity
- **Consolidated 4 workflows → 2 unified deployment workflows (deploy/undeploy)**
- **Added workflow tracking system** with complete event correlation
- **Simplified API surface** - single `/deploy` endpoint handles all scenarios
- **Enhanced observability** through event sourcing with workflow grouping

## How (High Level)

### Architectural Philosophy
**Embrace simplicity over framework complexity** - use well-structured Python with proper database design instead of complex orchestration frameworks.

### Core Components

#### 1. Unified Deployment Workflow
```python
class TenantDeploymentWorkflow:
    async def deploy_tenant_workflow(self, tenant_id: str, workflow_id: UUID, image_tag: str = None):
        # Single workflow handles both initial provisioning AND updates
        # Each step is idempotent and handles its own error recovery
        # Database transactions provide the durability we need
        await self.start_deployment_step(workflow_id, tenant_uuid, image_tag)
        await self.create_fly_app_step(workflow_id, tenant_uuid)
        await self.create_bucket_step(workflow_id, tenant_uuid)
        await self.deploy_machine_step(workflow_id, tenant_uuid, image_tag)
        await self.complete_deployment_step(workflow_id, tenant_uuid, image_tag, deployment_time)
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Handles both provisioning and updates** in single workflow
- **Idempotent operations** - safe to retry any step
- **Clean error handling** via simple Python exceptions
- **Resumable** - can restart from any failed step

#### 2. Workflow Tracking System

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE workflow (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- 'tenant_deployment', 'tenant_undeploy'
    tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenant(id),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'running', -- 'running', 'completed', 'failed'
    workflow_metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'  -- image_tag, etc.
);

ALTER TABLE event ADD COLUMN workflow_id UUID REFERENCES workflow(id);
```

**Event Correlation:**
- Every workflow operation generates events tagged with `workflow_id`
- Complete audit trail from workflow start to completion
- Events grouped by workflow for easy reconstruction of operations

#### 3. Parameter Standardization
All workflow methods follow consistent signature pattern:
```python
async def method_name(self, session: AsyncSession, workflow_id: UUID | None, tenant_id: UUID, ...)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Consistent event tagging** - all events properly correlated
- **Clear method contracts** - workflow_id always first parameter
- **Type safety** - proper UUID handling throughout

- No retry mechanism for failed operations
- HTTP timeouts on long-running deployments
- Poor user experience during infrastructure provisioning

**Solution**: Redis-backed job queue with arq for reliable background processing

#### Architecture Overview
```python
# API Layer: Return immediately with job tracking
@router.post("/{tenant_id}/deploy")
async def deploy_tenant(tenant_id: UUID):
    # Create workflow record in Postgres
    workflow = await workflow_repo.create_workflow("tenant_deployment", tenant_id)

    # Enqueue job in Redis
    job = await arq_pool.enqueue_job('deploy_tenant_task', tenant_id, workflow.id)

    # Return job ID immediately
    return {"job_id": job.job_id, "workflow_id": workflow.id, "status": "queued"}

# Background Worker: Process via existing unified workflow
async def deploy_tenant_task(ctx, tenant_id: str, workflow_id: str):
    # Existing workflow logic - zero changes needed!
    await workflow_manager.deploy_tenant(UUID(tenant_id), workflow_id=UUID(workflow_id))
```

- **Event correlation preserved** - all existing workflow tracking and event sourcing continues to work
- **Enhanced CLI tooling** - unified tenant commands with proper endpoint routing
- **Database integrity** - proper foreign key constraint handling in tenant deletion

#### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Local**: Redis via docker-compose (already exists) ✅
- **Production**: Upstash Redis on Fly.io (already configured) ✅
- **Workers**: arq worker processes (new deployment target)
- **Monitoring**: Job status dashboard (simple web interface)

#### API Evolution
```python
# Before: Synchronous (blocks for 60+ seconds)
POST /tenant/{id}/deploy → {status: "active", machine_id: "..."}

# After: Asynchronous (returns immediately)
POST /tenant/{id}/deploy → {job_id: "uuid", workflow_id: "uuid", status: "queued"}
GET  /jobs/{job_id}/status → {status: "running", progress: "deploying_machine", workflow_id: "uuid"}
GET  /workflows/{workflow_id}/events → [...] # Existing event tracking works unchanged
```

**Technology Choice**: **arq (Redis)** over pgqueuer
- **Existing Redis infrastructure** - Upstash + docker-compose already configured
- **Better ecosystem** - monitoring tools, documentation, community
- **Made by pydantic team** - aligns with existing Python stack
- **Hybrid approach** - Redis for queue operations + Postgres for workflow state

#### Job Uniqueness Implementation

**Problem**: Multiple concurrent deployment requests for the same tenant could create duplicate jobs, wasting resources and potentially causing conflicts.

**Solution**: Leverage ARQ's built-in job uniqueness feature using predictable job IDs:

```python
# JobQueueService implementation
async def enqueue_deploy_job(self, tenant_id: UUID, image_tag: str | None = None) -> str:
    unique_job_id = f"deploy-{tenant_id}"

    job = await self.redis_pool.enqueue_job(
        "deploy_tenant_job",
        str(tenant_id),
        image_tag,
        _job_id=unique_job_id,  # ARQ prevents duplicates
    )

    if job is None:
        # Job already exists - return existing job ID
        return unique_job_id
    else:
        # New job created - return ARQ job ID
        return job.job_id
```

**Key Features:**
- **Predictable Job IDs**: `deploy-{tenant_id}`, `undeploy-{tenant_id}`
- **Duplicate Prevention**: ARQ returns `None` for duplicate job IDs
- **Graceful Handling**: Return existing job ID instead of raising errors
- **Idempotent Operations**: Safe to retry deployment requests
- **Clear Logging**: Distinguish "Enqueued new" vs "Found existing" jobs

**Benefits:**
- Prevents resource waste from duplicate deployments
- Eliminates race conditions from concurrent requests
- Makes job monitoring more predictable with consistent IDs
- Provides natural deduplication without complex locking mechanisms


## Notes

### Design Philosophy Lessons
- **Simplicity beats framework magic** - removing DBOS made the system more reliable and debuggable
- **Event sourcing > complex orchestration** - database-backed event tracking provides better observability than framework abstractions
- **Idempotent operations > resumable workflows** - each step handling its own retry logic is simpler than framework-managed resumability
- **Explicit error handling > framework exception handling** - Python exceptions are clearer than orchestration framework error states

### Future Considerations
- **Monitoring integration** - workflow tracking events could feed into observability systems
- **Performance optimization** - event querying patterns may benefit from additional indexing
- **Audit compliance** - complete event trail supports regulatory requirements
- **Operational dashboards** - workflow status could drive tenant health monitoring

## Implementation Notes

### Configuration Integration
- **Redis Configuration**: Add Redis settings to existing `apps/cloud/src/basic_memory_cloud/config.py`
- **Local Development**: Leverage existing Redis setup from `docker-compose.yml`
- **Production**: Use Upstash Redis configuration for production environments

### Docker Entrypoint Strategy
Create `entrypoint.sh` script to toggle between API server and worker processes using single Docker image:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Entrypoint script for Basic Memory Cloud service
# Supports multiple process types: api, worker

set -e

case "$1" in
  "api")
    echo "Starting Basic Memory Cloud API server..."
    exec uvicorn basic_memory_cloud.main:app \
      --host 0.0.0.0 \
      --port 8000 \
      --log-level info
    ;;
  "worker")
    echo "Starting Basic Memory Cloud ARQ worker..."
    # For ARQ worker implementation
    exec python -m arq basic_memory_cloud.jobs.settings.WorkerSettings
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Usage: $0 {api|worker}"
    echo "  api    - Start the FastAPI server"
    echo "  worker - Start the ARQ worker"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
```

### Fly.io Process Groups Configuration
Use separate machine groups for API and worker processes with independent scaling:

```toml
# fly.toml app configuration for basic-memory-cloud
app = 'basic-memory-cloud-dev-basic-machines'
primary_region = 'dfw'
org = 'basic-machines'
kill_signal = 'SIGINT'
kill_timeout = '5s'

[build]

# Process groups for API server and worker
[processes]
  api = "api"
  worker = "worker"

# Machine scaling configuration
[[machine]]
  size = 'shared-cpu-1x'
  processes = ['api']
  min_machines_running = 1
  auto_stop_machines = false
  auto_start_machines = true

[[machine]]
  size = 'shared-cpu-1x'
  processes = ['worker']
  min_machines_running = 1
  auto_stop_machines = false
  auto_start_machines = true

[env]
  # Python configuration
  PYTHONUNBUFFERED = '1'
  PYTHONPATH = '/app'

  # Logging configuration
  LOG_LEVEL = 'DEBUG'

  # Redis configuration for ARQ
  REDIS_URL = 'redis://basic-memory-cloud-redis.upstash.io'

  # Database configuration
  DATABASE_HOST = 'basic-memory-cloud-db-dev-basic-machines.internal'
  DATABASE_PORT = '5432'
  DATABASE_NAME = 'basic_memory_cloud'
  DATABASE_USER = 'postgres'
  DATABASE_SSL = 'true'

  # Worker configuration
  ARQ_MAX_JOBS = '10'
  ARQ_KEEP_RESULT = '3600'

  # Fly.io configuration
  FLY_ORG = 'basic-machines'
  FLY_REGION = 'dfw'

# Internal service - no external HTTP exposure for worker
# API accessible via basic-memory-cloud-dev-basic-machines.flycast:8000

[[vm]]
  size = 'shared-cpu-1x'
```

### Benefits of This Architecture
- **Single Docker Image**: Both API and worker use same container with different entrypoints
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale API and worker processes separately based on demand
- **Clean Separation**: Web traffic handling separate from background job processing
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverages current PostgreSQL + Redis setup without complexity
- **Hybrid State Management**: Redis for queue operations, PostgreSQL for persistent workflow tracking

## Relations

- implements [[SPEC-8 TigrisFS Integration]]
- follows [[SPEC-1 Specification-Driven Development Process]]
- supersedes previous multi-workflow architecture
