"""
Integration test for long relation_type values (regression guard for issue #721).

When a markdown bullet contains an inline `[[wikilink]]` preceded by long prose,
`parse_relation()` extracts ALL of that prose as the `relation_type`. Previously
the response model `RelationType` had a `MaxLen(200)` constraint that caused
edit_note (which round-trips through the response model when re-indexing) to
fail with:

    1 validation error for EntityResponseV2
    relations.0.relation_type
      String should have at most 200 characters

Commit 01cbad1d removed the cap from `RelationType`. This test locks in that
fix so a future contributor reintroducing `MaxLen` will see the test fail
before shipping it.

Out of scope: improving `parse_relation()` to fall back to a default relation
type when the prose-before-link looks like a sentence rather than a label.
That's a knowledge-graph-quality improvement, not a correctness fix, and is
not required to keep edit_note working.
